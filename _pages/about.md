Hello, my name is Kedi Chen (陈可迪), you can call me Andy Chen. My hometown is Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu Province in China, and I currently live in Shanghai. 

I am now a joint Ph.D. student of East China Normal University (ECNU) and Shanghai Innovation Institute (SII), supervised by [Prof. Wei Zhang](https://weizhangltt.github.io/).
I have been studied Natural Language Processing since 2020 and I am familiar with Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLM).
My research interests include but not limit to **LLM reasoning**, **LLM backbone training**, **Agentic LLM**, and **LLM hallucination**.
